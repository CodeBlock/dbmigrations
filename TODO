- make InitFS support recursive adding/reverting (partially done)

- make InitFS refuse to apply a migration that is already installed or
  revert one that is not installed (partially done)

- add test for createNewMigration

- InitFS: add a "--test" option to apply/revert operations which
  ROLLBACK instead of COMMIT when finished

- InitFS: add optparse support instead of pattern-matching/breaking on
  args

- add tests for new depGraphFromMapping function

- handle SQLErrors gracefully in InitFS

- make filesystem store operations die if they find a migration name
  with no corresponding disk file

- clean up code formatting (too many long lines, not enough
  decomposition)

- since bootstrapping is actually special, consider making it special
  (and not storing a bootstrapping migration in the store)

- tool to show dependency hierarchy

- detect whether a store has already been initialized (presence of
  a *parsable* root migration?)

  - add a magic file/something to a store so we know if it's a store

- possibly limit how big a migration file can be to prevent tarpits (1
  MB?)

- how best (easiest for user) to tell tools how to access migration
  store and backend?  environment variables? configuration file?
  command-line arguments?  probably not *required* args, since you
  need to be able to invoke the tools quickly and easily

- command-line tool to connect to a database and interactively prompt
  to revert or apply, or to take a migration id on the command line

  - read config files of different types (django, rails, etc) or a way
    to convert configs to some normalized form (environment variables,
    etc) or at least a way to just take a DSN on the command line for
    starters

- postgres support

  - postgres tests
