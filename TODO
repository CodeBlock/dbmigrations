- Moo: Use sys.argv[0] in usage string

- InitFS: add a flag (--summary) to upgrade, apply, and revert; remove
  upgrade-list command; have --summary show the user what will be done
  without actually doing it.

- InitFS "new" confirmation: display deps in columns, sorted
  alphabetically, so we don't have to invoke a pager

- InitFS "new" command deps selection: allow j/k navigation a la darcs

- make filesystem store operations die if they find a migration name
  with no corresponding disk file

- possibly limit how big a migration file can be to prevent tarpits (1
  MB?)

- how best (easiest for user) to tell tools how to access migration
  store and backend?  environment variables? configuration file?
  command-line arguments?  probably not *required* args, since you
  need to be able to invoke the tools quickly and easily

Testing
=======

- improve test coverage

- Make tests display warning if they can't run the postgres tests due
  to tools not being present (createdb, dropdb) -- check that those
  exist in advance.  Also gracefully do not run the pgsql tests if the
  test database cannot be created for some other reason (permissions).

StoreManager
============

- Add abillity to modify the dependency list of a migration

  - don't ask about dependencies that would result in a
  graph cycle

- list migrations

- let user select dependencies

- tool to show dependency hierarchy

- support for creating and editing migrations

  - editing: fire up editor with migration in a temp file, when editor
    closes, parse the migration and tell the user if there was a
    problem, then ask to re-invoke editor or quit. if no parse error,
    overwrite original migration file with temp file contents.
