- InitFS: add command to list migrations not yet installed

- InitFS: add an "--ask" option to the "new" command which will
  interactively prompt for dependencies and set them when creating the
  migration (or even have this behavior be the default, with a
  "--no-ask" option to turn it off)

- curses tool to select dependencies for a migration? could also be
  used to render / navigate a dependency structure

  - tool to show dependency hierarchy

- improve test coverage

- make filesystem store operations die if they find a migration name
  with no corresponding disk file

- clean up code formatting (too many long lines, not enough
  decomposition)

- possibly limit how big a migration file can be to prevent tarpits (1
  MB?)

- how best (easiest for user) to tell tools how to access migration
  store and backend?  environment variables? configuration file?
  command-line arguments?  probably not *required* args, since you
  need to be able to invoke the tools quickly and easily

- postgres support

  - postgres tests
