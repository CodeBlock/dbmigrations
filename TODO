- InitFS: add an "--ask" option to the "new" command which will
  interactively prompt for dependencies and set them when creating the
  migration (or even have this behavior be the default, with a
  "--no-ask" option to turn it off)

  (mostly done; don't ask about dependencies that would result in a
  graph cycle!)

  (also need to do a confirmation prompt before creating new
  migrations)

- curses tool to select dependencies for a migration? could also be
  used to render / navigate a dependency structure

  - list migrations

  - let user select dependencies

  - tool to show dependency hierarchy

  - support for creating and editing migrations

    - editing: fire up editor with migration in a temp file, when
      editor closes, parse the migration and tell the user if there
      was a problem, then ask to re-invoke editor or quit. if no parse
      error, overwrite original migration file with temp file
      contents.

- Rename InitFS / initstore-fs

- improve test coverage

- make filesystem store operations die if they find a migration name
  with no corresponding disk file

- clean up code formatting (too many long lines, not enough
  decomposition)

- possibly limit how big a migration file can be to prevent tarpits (1
  MB?)

- how best (easiest for user) to tell tools how to access migration
  store and backend?  environment variables? configuration file?
  command-line arguments?  probably not *required* args, since you
  need to be able to invoke the tools quickly and easily

- postgres support

  - postgres tests
