- InitFS: refactor common logic out of testCommand, applyCommand, and
  revertCommand

- InitFS: add an "--ask" option to the "new" command which will
  interactively prompt for dependencies and set them when creating the
  migration (or even have this behavior be the default, with a
  "--no-ask" option to turn it off)

- make filesystem migration-loading ignore backup files (need a
  general solution to this problem)

- add test for createNewMigration

- add tests for new depGraphFromMapping function

- handle SQLErrors gracefully in InitFS

- make filesystem store operations die if they find a migration name
  with no corresponding disk file

- clean up code formatting (too many long lines, not enough
  decomposition)

- tool to show dependency hierarchy

- detect whether a store has already been initialized (presence of
  a *parsable* root migration?)

  - add a magic file/something to a store so we know if it's a store

- possibly limit how big a migration file can be to prevent tarpits (1
  MB?)

- how best (easiest for user) to tell tools how to access migration
  store and backend?  environment variables? configuration file?
  command-line arguments?  probably not *required* args, since you
  need to be able to invoke the tools quickly and easily

- command-line tool to connect to a database and interactively prompt
  to revert or apply, or to take a migration id on the command line

  - read config files of different types (django, rails, etc) or a way
    to convert configs to some normalized form (environment variables,
    etc) or at least a way to just take a DSN on the command line for
    starters

- postgres support

  - postgres tests
